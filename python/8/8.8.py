#8.8 Exercise: Using a loop to add into a 2D array.
#An 11 year old wants a program which will ask for the names of 5 friends to invite to her party and ask the food they will bring. The program will add the names and food items to a 2D list. At the end it will print the entire matrix as neatly as possible! Try:
#1. Declare an empty party_list
#2. Use a loop to ask for 5 names and 5 items
#3. In the loop, create a list containing the name and item, and then append that list to the
#main party_list
#4. Print final party list
